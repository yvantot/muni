BUGS
--> When user added multiple modules/units/cards unedited and try to batch-edit, the update logic will turn other inputs to a placeholder
    This can be easily fixed with 'reason' rendering logic

- Works as tab/newtab/popup
- Hover or click to reveal answer
- Allow hints feature
- Tags
- Focused session
- User settings
- Question Popup (only flashcard for now) must work for focused & unfocused window
- Module System
- AI Prompt for automated q/a input
- Q/A input syntax
- Custom rules when popup will appear

- To implement
- Export/Import data
- PWA support
- Different type of questions support, images, links support
- Text-editor
- Stats visualization
- Website support (local storage)

- on Storage change should have a reason property to make rendering more flexible
- Make code modular
